* Lecture 1a
1# Computer science vs computer art

2# Computer science is not that much about computer, but focuses on
how to formalize process--how to do things. And procedure--local
prescription of process, is used to generate the process we want.

3# Declarative vs Imperative knowledge.

4# Techniques used to design procedure to generating complex
processes: black-box abstraction, conventional interface, and
metalinguistic abstraction.
