I try to take as least primitives from the support code as possible. 
There are just two primitives I had to take from the support code.
And I will re-implement all the other "primitives" based on the 
two from support code.

1. segments->painter, I'd like to have draw-line, which is not included in
the support code.

2.  load-painter, make a painter from a picture.

See get-familiar.scm to see the code used to get familiar with this picture
language.
