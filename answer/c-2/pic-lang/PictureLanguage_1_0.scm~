;;; This file provides the basic implementation of the Picture Language.
;;; It includes definitions for both the higher-level procedures used
;;; for combinning painters via different patterns and lower-level
;;; procedures for creating primitive painters, frames, segements and vectors.
;;;
;;; To render the constructed images, the implementation 
;;; uses standard PLT Racket libraries for creating bitmaps, frames and
;;; canvases. For more information consult the PLT documentation:
;;; http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/drawing-overview.html
;;;
;;; The code written is an adaptation of code from the book:
;;; "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", Section 2.2.4 
;;; The book can be found at: http://http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html

;; Some terminology:
;;
;; "Painter" is a class of procedures that take a signle argument of type
;; frame and draw some picture in the space specified by the frame.
;;
;; A "Frame" is a data-structure consisting of 3 vectors: origin, edge1 and
;; edge2. The origin specifies the offset of the frame's origin from some 
;; absolute origin in the plane, and the edge vectors specify the offsets of
;; the frame's corners from its origin.
