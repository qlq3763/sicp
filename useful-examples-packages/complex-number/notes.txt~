If I want to use numbers(Integer and real) like the built-in ones. I
have to change the procedures manipulating tags:attach-tag, tag-type
and contents. And I think this is a "case on type" style(which I don't
like), and this method also put some "business" about Integer and
real-number to the tag-manipulating procedures(I don't like either). 

I've split integer and real number into two packages. But this also 
has some tricky points: I can not use attach-tag in integer and real
number package, because some operations on integer will produce real
number and vice versa. For example (sine 3) will procedure a real
number and (add 0.5 0.5) will produce an integer.
